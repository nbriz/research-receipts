  "title": "71% of Facebook Users Engage in 'Self-Censorship'",
  "author": "Alexis C. Madrigal",
  "tldr": "Facebook conducted a study on 3.9 million users to measure how many people typed more than five characters into Facebook content-input boxes, but then did not post them. ",
  "reasons": "Facebook is part of the \"attention economy\", they make more money the more time you spend on their platform. For this reason the algorithm they use to generate your feed is designed to keep you engaged and generating data. What Facebook calls \"self-censorship\" is arguably the type of behavior they want to discourage, knowing that they record and analyze this is a reminder of the lengths to which Facebook goes to understand and in turn influence our choices.",
  "verified": "The Atlantic is a well respected American Magazine founded in 1857. According to the Ad Fontes Media Bias Chart it is a relatively balanced publication which skews left. This article was written in 2013 by Alexis Madrigal who is a staff writer at the Atlantic. I've been following him for a while, technology is one of his \"beats\" (he's also written for Wired Magazine), he's a Harvard graduate and a thought leader in his industry having spoken at conferences like the Aspen Ideas Festival."
